- Top suppliers by total products sold
- Low stock products
- Month-over-month sales trends
- Most popular product per category (optional)

## How to Run
1. Load the database schema (`schema.sql`) and sample data (`sample_data.sql`) into a SQL database (MySQL, Postgres, or DB Fiddle).  
2. Run the queries in `queries.sql`.  
3. Review output tables to get insights into revenue, inventory, and supplier performance.
